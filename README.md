## Assignment 6 
By Samuel Najera

This is a program meant to demonstrate class inheritence and methods. There is a superclass, Animal, that has set parameters and two public methods.
There are two subclasses, Fish and Zebra, that inherit those parameters and methods and have their own methods exclusive to them. This exercise demonstrates
establishing these classes and subclasses, as well as calling their associated methods.
